## Quickstart
---
To run this project you need to run Ollama beforehand.

First of all you need to install all dependencies via npm. To do that you should write this commadn in the directory of the project:
```
npm i
```

After installation you should write next command to initialise sqlite database:
```
npm run initDB
```

After succesfull message run next command:
```
npm start
```

And that's it! You should be able to register and login on yout localhost:3030

## Why does this project exist

I am a starting developer and programming is my passion. For that I want to contribute to the opensource community with my, to be honest, halfbaked project.
I am sure that it will not gain any significat influence but I hope that by sharing my project that is targeted for starting developers just like myself I could expire someone to code and give more to this world.

Thank you.
